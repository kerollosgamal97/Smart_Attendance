# Smart Attendance
## Description
### Keeping track of attendance in classes is usually a tiring process that requires a lot of paperwork and time that TAs waste to correctly assign attendance marks to students thus there is a need for a friendly system capable of tracking attendance correctly and efficiently.
### The attendance tracking system will be able to track students attendance via a mobile app that can take images of students ID cards and extract their ID numbers and store it for the TAs for later processing.
