# Smart_Attendance
## Keeping track of attendance in classes is usually a tiring process that requires a lot of paperwork and time that TAs waste to correctly assign attendance marks to students thus there is a need for a friendly system capable of tracking attendance correctly and efficiently.
## The attendance tracking system will be able to track studentsâ€™attendance via a mobile app that can take images of studentsâ€™ID cards and extract their ID numbers and store it for the TAs for later processing. Students can also verify that their attendance marks have been assigned correctly through the app.
